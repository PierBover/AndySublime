HTML completions and attributes.

I've added HTML5 tags and attributes.

I'm considering amending the completions to add 
an extra tab position within the opening tag. I 
might do this for all of the tags, or just for 
those ones where additional attributes are nearly 
always added - such as DIV, SPAN, etc..

For the moment I've added action and method to the 
form' completion, and type to input. These also 
include value-completions. That is, type g for get, 
p for post, c for checkbox, etc.

The canvas tag includes width and height attributes 
as these are essential.

I've added the href attribute to 'base' and src to 
'iframe'.
