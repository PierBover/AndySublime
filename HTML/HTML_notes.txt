HTML completions and attributes.

I've added HTML5 tags and attributes.

I'm considering amending the completions to add 
an extra tab position within the opening tag. I 
might do this for all of the tags, or just for 
those ones where additional attributes are nearly 
always added - such as DIV, SPAN, etc..
