CSS and JavaScript completions for Sublime Text 2.

It is recommended to adjust the setting "auto_complete_delay" to prevent the completions 
(particularly the JS ones) not appearing too quickly.

With the JS completions, typing, for example 'aler' for 'window.alert()' will automatically 
pre-pend 'window'. However, typing 'mywin.aler' will just complete 'alert()'.

The CSS completions will complete many values for you. For example, the border property 
allows you to type the single letter 'm' for medium, 't' for 'thin' and 'th' for 'thick'. 
There are many such abbreviations.

Another example: Using the 'borderwidth4' trigger, if you type '10px' it will write 
'10px px px px' and you can tab to the other three positions to add the number of pixels. 
If you don't want pixels for all four then you should modify it once you've tabbed out of 
the completion.
